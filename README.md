- Create a text filter for products names;
- Conditional rendering of products in the home page based on the category;
- By clicking in a product card, user must be redirected to product page;
- Render all the reviews existing in the API for each product;
- Another products section can be whatever products carousel you want;
- By clicking the “Add To Cart” button, the product must be added to the cart;
- Use Context API to manage the cart;
- The products must be removable from the cart;
- The products can be added as many times as user wants;
- The filter screen needs to be a bottom sheet (use [**React Sprint Bottom Sheet**](https://react-spring.bottom-sheet.dev/));
- The filter screen will be triggered on the click of “Filter” button;
- Implement the filter using the products from API;
- In the cart screen, calculate the total value based on the products added.
